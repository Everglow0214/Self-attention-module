# Self-attention-module
Homework #1 for EE898 (Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Robotics and Computer Vision)
Three self-attention modules based on three papers are implemented, which are:
[Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507),
[CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521), and
[BAM: Bottleneck Attention Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06514)
with the baseline being ResNet, proposed in
[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).
