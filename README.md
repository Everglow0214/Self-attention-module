# Self-attention-module
Homework #1 for EE898 (Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Robotics and Computer Vision)
Three self-attention modules based on three papers are implemented, which are:
Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks,
CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module, and
BAM: Bottleneck Attention Module
with the baseline being ResNet, proposed in
Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.
